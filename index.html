							<h3>What is 'Grounded'?</h3>
							<p>Grounded' is a smart bin, designed to encourage New Zealanders
                 to essentially 'reduce, reuse and recycle' by earning points and
                rewards. </p>
								<p>It works you, the user, disposing your rubbish into one of the
Grounded bin. Once it's been disposed in the bin, a QR code will
appear in the screen above the rubbish slot. Primarily, you will
have installed the app and created an account. You will then
open the camera on the app and scan the QR code.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of weight of the waste, you will earn points that
you can the convert into New Zealand dollars. You can either spend these money
by shopping in the Marketplace or donate to any
organizations you please.</p>
<p>This system will not only motivate citizens to recycle but it will
also promote environmental awareness in a collaborative way.</p>

<h3>Disposing Correctlty</h3>
<p>When it comes to rubbish, for most people it truly is a case of ‘out of sight, out of mind’.
	But in order to minimise your impact on the environment, waste management needs to be made smarter.
	And there’s only so much that waste management organisations, engineering and breakthroughs in new
	technology can do.</p>
	<p>With the high volume of waste that materials recovery facilities have to process, it is simply
		unviable for workers to sort through every item coming through. To ensure that recycled materials
		are being recycled and that hazardous materials are in no risk of causing a dangerous fire, it is
		essential to carefully sort through your waste to ensure that all of your waste is going exactly
		where it should be.</p>
<p>Smart bins are organised by Paper, Plastic, Glass, Cans and Landfills. To ensure you are contributing
great choices to the environment, make sure to dispose your trash in the right bin.</p>
<h3>How the conversion works</h3>
<p>Every 10 points equals to $1. To be able to convert earned points into dollars, a minimum
of 100 points is needed. </p>
